## How to visualize a simulation
Assuming you already have a .txt file that is the output of the generation of the simulation you just need to do the following:
1) Create a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) by running: `virtualenv venv --python=python3`
2) Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3) Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4) Run the visualization script! `python visualization.py`
